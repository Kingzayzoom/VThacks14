**Last updated: 18 September 2026 — renamed to CortexAi; the Next.js frontend is the one that ships.**

Quick numbers: 4,508 lines of application Python · 819 lines of tests · 90 unit tests passing ·
five demo scenarios green end to end · 8,100 lines of Next.js frontend that builds clean and is
**not yet connected to any of it** (§5).

---

## 1. What this is

**Hire AI agents you can actually trust.** A person types one goal in plain English. A Commander
agent works out what it involves, discovers specialist agents from other organisations, proves
who they are through GoDaddy's Agent Name Service, gives each one narrowly scoped permission for
that mission only, watches what they do, blocks what they are not allowed to do, verifies the
work they return, and produces something real at the end.

The claim the whole thing is built to support:

> **Verified identity is not unlimited authority.** Knowing exactly who an agent is tells you
> nothing about what it should be allowed to do, and both questions have to be answered
> separately, visibly, and before any work happens.

Built for VTHacks 14, GoDaddy "Best Use of ANS" track. The five companies are fictional and all
ours; every registration, certificate, signature, revocation and log proof is real cryptography.

## 2. What it has to do

**For the track:** use ANS for what it is actually for — identity, discovery, lifecycle — and
be honest about the line between what ANS proves and what we decide.

**For the demo:** a mission that completes in a couple of minutes, in front of people, without a
network, with five things going wrong on purpose and being handled visibly.

**Constraints we hold ourselves to:**
- Never show a green check we did not earn. Evidence-unavailable is its own state, not a pass.
- Demo mode and live mode are both honest; neither pretends to be the other.
- No secret ever crosses into the browser.
- Every UI state comes from application state, never from a timer.
- Fail closed, and say which kind of no it was.

## 3. How it fits together

```
dashboard (browser) ──WebSocket──▶ hub :8000 ◀── events from every agent
                                     │  │
                                     │  └── Guardian: grants, scopes, action decisions
                                     ▼
                              Commander :8001 ──hires──▶ Brand :8002 · WebForge :8003
                                     │                   SiteSmith :8004 · Compliance :8005
                                     │                   (Impostor :8006, not in ANS)
                                     ▼
                     ANS: local simulator :8100, or GoDaddy's hosted API
```

Three boundaries that matter:
- **The Trust Gate** decides who gets in. Runs in every agent, not just the Commander — vendors
  verify the Commander before working for it.
- **The Guardian** decides what they may do once in. Lives in the hub so it can refuse the
  Commander and the agents alike; neither can switch it off.
- **ANS** answers who someone is. It does not answer whether they should be trusted with this
  job — that is ours, and conflating the two is the mistake the product exists to avoid.

## 4. What is done

### Identity and trust — complete
- **Five-stage Trust Gate**: resolve · authenticate · status · capability · policy, each with its
  own evidence. ECDSA P-256, X.509 certificates chained to the ANS CA with the ANS name in the
  SAN URI, RFC-9162 Merkle inclusion proofs.
- **Registration**: key → CSR → DNS challenge → CA-issued certificate → ACTIVE.
- **Standing separated from inclusion.** A transparency-log receipt proves a registration
  happened and keeps proving it after a revocation; a short-lived signed status token proves good
  standing *now*. Only the second can catch a revoked agent.
- **Offline verification.** Agents attach `X-ANS-Status-Token` to their own responses; we verify
  against cached root keys with no registry round-trip, and presented tokens are pinned to their
  subject so nobody can present a healthy neighbour's.
- **Four check states**: `pass · fail · unverified · not_run`. "The evidence says no" and "we
  could not get the evidence" both refuse the hire and are never drawn the same way.
- **Signed deliverables bound to their job.** Job and mission ids are signed and checked, so work
  signed perfectly well an hour ago cannot be handed back as today's.
- **Challenge signing is domain-separated**, so the challenge endpoint cannot be used as an
  oracle to forge deliverable signatures.

### Authority — complete
- **Mission-scoped grants**: this agent, this mission, these scopes, until this time. Issued per
  job by the Commander over a signed request; never inherited, never widened after the fact.
- **Deterministic policy engine**: hard denies no human can approve, scope matching, human review
  for outward-facing actions bound to an exact payload digest and usable once.
- **Network actions go out through the Guardian**, against its own allowlist, with the URL's host
  pinned to the granted host. Agents have no outbound path of their own.

### Orchestration — complete
- **Plans are dependency graphs**, one to six tasks, validated server-side before anything runs.
  Invalid plans go back to the model once with specific complaints, then fall back.
- **Roster and recruitment**: `capability.missing` when we have never had anyone,
  `recruitment.replacement_requested` when we had someone and lost them, `capability.covered`
  when we already have someone. Recruitment records keep candidates *and* refusals.
- **Reuse re-checks what can change** — standing and version — and a version change forces a full
  re-verification rather than inheriting an old admission.

### The five scenarios — all passing
| | what happens |
|---|---|
| Impostor | copies a real public identity, fails `authenticate` and `policy`, blocked |
| Revocation | WebForge revoked mid-job; deliverable discarded, SiteSmith backfills |
| Version change | LegalCheck ships v1.1 unannounced; mission pauses for a human |
| Scope violation | site builder tries to send the brand kit off-site; Guardian refuses |
| Human review | publish request waits for a person, runs once, cannot be replayed |

### Supporting
- `GET /api/integrations/status` — probed live, never inferred from environment variables.
- **90 unit tests**, none needing a server: trust, standing, guardian, planning, execution, results.
- `scripts/smoke_test.py` — the whole demo asserted end to end.
- `scripts/check_ans.py` — read-only preflight against the live GoDaddy API.
- `docs/contracts.md` — every route, event and object the frontend needs.
- `docs/godaddy-questions.md` — the six things the public docs do not settle.

## 5. The frontend

Roheen pushed a complete **Next.js frontend**, merged into `main` (`a3807aa`). It is a
substantial, genuinely well-made piece of work — and it is **not connected to any of the above.**
That is deliberate on their side, documented in `AGENTS.md` and `PLAN.md` as a Phase A boundary,
and it is the single largest piece of remaining work on the project.

### What was built

| | |
|---|---|
| Stack | Next.js 16.3.5 (App Router), React 19, strict TypeScript, Tailwind 4, Framer Motion, Zod, Playwright + axe-core |
| Size | ~3,800 lines TS/TSX, ~5,200 lines CSS, 9,000 total |
| Routes | `/` · `/field` · `/agents` · `/missions` · `/missions/[id]` · `/settings` (6 of the 10 the brief lists) |
| Build | **Clean.** `npm run typecheck` passes, `npm run build` compiles in 7s, 7 routes generated |
| Tests | Playwright specs covering reduced motion, canvas-failure fallback, accessibility, wide/compact desktop, mobile, and the agents console |
| Extras | Procedural Canvas atmosphere, shared frame clock, visual-pause and reduced-motion support, self-hosted fonts |

### What it does well, and should be preserved

- **It does not claim verification it has not earned.** Fixture agents carry
  `identityStatus: "demo_verified"` and `verificationEvidence: ["Built-in demo fixture. No ANS
  registration."]`. That is exactly the house rule, followed without being asked.
- **It keeps runtime, identity and authorization separate** — three of the four states an agent
  node must distinguish. Only the per-check breakdown is missing.
- Accessibility and reduced-motion are tested, not assumed.
- Strict typing with Zod contracts at the boundary.

### The gap

**There is not one network call in the entire frontend.** No `fetch`, no WebSocket, no URL.

```
src/lib/api/HttpControlApi.ts   throws NOT_CONFIGURED — "No network calls in Phase A"
src/components/provider.tsx     hardwired to MockControlApi
src/lib/env/config.ts           live mode is explicitly available: false
```

State lives in `MockControlApi` and `localStorage`, driven by fixtures.

### Why the contracts do not match

The frontend was built against **`MASTER_PROMPT.md`** — the original design brief — rather than
against [`contracts.md`](contracts.md), which describes what the backend actually emits. Both were
reasonable things to build from. They describe different systems.

| | Backend emits | Frontend expects |
|---|---|---|
| Event envelope | `{id, ts, type, message, actor, subject, mission_id, data}` | `{schemaVersion, id, sequence, occurredAt, source, missionId, correlationId, type, payload}` |
| Event types | 30+, incl. `trust.check`, `agent.admitted`, `action.blocked` | 4: `mission.created`, `mission.state_changed`, `task.progress`, `capability.missing` |
| Casing | `snake_case` | `camelCase` |
| Mission | `text`, `business`, `jobs[]`, `hires[]`, `recruitments[]`, `roster[]`, `plan` | `title`, `objective`, `constraints[]`, `taskIds[]`, `budget`, `currentStage` |
| Agent | `ans_name`, `org`, `version`, `status`, `fingerprint`, `capabilities[]` | `identityStatus` (one enum), `authorizationSummary`, `verificationEvidence[]` |
| Trust | 5 checks × 4 states, each with evidence | a single `identityStatus` enum |
| Cast | BrandStudio, WebForge, SiteSmith, LegalCheck, Commander | Scout, Sage, Forge, Guardian, CortexAi |

The frontend also has slots for things the backend does not produce (`budget`, `constraints`,
`artifactIds`, `attempt`), and no slot for things it does (the five-row gate, recruitment
candidates and refusals, Guardian decision rules, the plan graph, `age_seconds` on standing).

### What this actually means

`PLAN.md` Phase D reads: *"Team connects Gemini, hosted workers, real ANS verification, server
policy gateway, persistence."* The frontend was planned on the assumption that **the backend does
not exist yet.** It has been finished for some time.

Neither half knew about the other. That is a coordination failure, not a competence one — both
halves are good work. But it means the integration is entirely ahead of us, and it is the biggest
single risk to the demo.

### Two frontends now exist

| | `dashboard/` | `src/` |
|---|---|---|
| Stack | plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build | Next.js + React + TS |
| Backend | **fully wired** — WebSocket, all routes, Guardian panel | **none** |
| Looks | functional | considerably better |
| Drives the demo today | yes | no |

### DECIDED: the Next.js app ships

`src/` is the product. `dashboard/` stays in the repo as a **working fallback and as a reference
implementation** — it is the only thing that currently proves every contract end to end, so it is
useful to diff against while wiring. **Do not delete it** until the Next.js app has run the full
demo, all five scenarios, at least twice.

That makes the integration the critical path. Two pieces, and they can be done in parallel by
different people:

**A. `HttpControlApi`** — implement the adapter that currently throws `NOT_CONFIGURED`. Fetch
against the hub on `:8000`, subscribe to `/ws`, feed the same store `MockControlApi` feeds so the
components do not have to change. `API_CONTRACT.md` already describes this seam.

**B. The mapping layer** — translate our shapes into theirs. This is the bulk of it. Mechanical,
but it is where the honesty rules live: five checks × four states must not collapse into a single
`identityStatus` enum without somewhere to show the detail.

Endpoint reconciliation, the frontend's proposal against what exists:

| Proposed | Reality |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/missions` with `Idempotency-Key` | exists, takes `{text, scenario}`; no idempotency key yet |
| `POST /api/missions/:id/commands` `{pause\|resume}` | **does not exist.** We have `/decision` for version approvals. Pause/resume is unbuilt |
| `GET /api/bootstrap` | `/api/state` + `/api/missions/current` cover it between them |
| `GET /api/events/stream` (SSE) | we have WebSocket `/ws`, which is strictly better here |

Agree those four before writing the adapter, and fold the result into
[`contracts.md`](contracts.md) — there are currently **two** contract documents
([`contracts.md`](contracts.md) from the backend, `API_CONTRACT.md` from the frontend) and that is
one too many.

## 6. What is not done

| | status |
|---|---|
| **Live GoDaddy ANS** | Client written against the published REST reference — auth, registration, resolution, capability search, revocation, certificates. **Never executed.** No token yet. |
| **SCITT COSE receipts** | Not implemented. Hosted receipts are COSE_Sign1; ours are JSON. Deliberate — use GoDaddy's `ans-verify` rather than writing a COSE parser in a weekend. |
| **mTLS / DPoP** | Our proof-of-possession is a nonce challenge against the same ANS certificate. Honest about being ours, not ANS's. |
| **Gemini** | Wired everywhere and never run — no key yet. See §7. |
| **Deployment** | Agents run on localhost. Live ANS needs them publicly reachable at their registered FQDNs. |
| **Frontend integration** | The Next.js app makes no network calls at all. Biggest remaining task — see §5. |
| **Voice / BRIEF ME** | Cut. Does not change what a judge sees. |

## 7. Gemini: built, blocked on a working key

Per-capability routing and the deterministic review floor are **done**. What is missing is a key
whose project can actually generate.

### Which brain does which job — `config/agents.yaml`

```yaml
llm:
  mission.plan:      gemini    # free text into a plan is the model-shaped task
  brand.identity:    gemini    # creative, cheap, visible variety per run
  site.generate:     offline   # the page is the artifact; the template never surprises us
  compliance.review: gemini    # good at reading a page — with the rule floor beneath it
```

`LLM_MODE` still overrides everything: `LLM_MODE=offline` makes the whole system deterministic
for rehearsals, `LLM_MODE=gemini` forces the model everywhere. No key means offline regardless.

### The review floor

The demo's review loop was engineered around the offline templates — the first draft genuinely
has no allergen notice, and the rule checks genuinely catch it. Handing that to a model alone
turned the beat into a coin flip.

Now the rule checks run on **every** review and their findings are not negotiable. The model adds
what a rule cannot express; it cannot take a rule finding away. Each issue is tagged `source:
"rule" | "model"`, duplicates collapse, and any high-severity finding from either blocks approval.
Ten tests cover it, including the one that matters: an approving model over a page that is
genuinely non-compliant still produces `approved: false`.

### The key we have does not work

`AIza...6go` is **valid** — it authenticates and lists 58 models. Its Google Cloud project has
**zero generation quota**:

```
429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED ... 'quota_limit_value': '0'
```

A limit of zero is not "you used it up", it is "this project was never allocated any". The usual
cause is a key created against an existing Cloud project that has no free-tier grant for the
Generative Language API.

**The fix:** at aistudio.google.com, create the key in a **new** project rather than an existing
one — AI Studio provisions free-tier quota automatically. Failing that, enable the Generative
Language API on project `803676840463` in the Cloud console and confirm the free tier applies.

### The silver lining

A configured-but-failing provider is exactly the mid-demo outage scenario, and we got to test it
for real. The full demo ran with the key in place: four `llm.fallback` events, Gemini reported
`DEGRADED` with the actual reason, every agent fell back to templates, and the mission delivered
with all five scenarios green. **Nothing pretended to work.** That is a good thing to be able to
say on stage, and it means a Gemini outage on Sunday costs us polish, not the demo.

### Still unverified

The planner has **never run against a real model**. Plan validation and the retry loop are
unit-tested against a scripted one, but the first thing to do with a working key is type *"just
make me a brand kit for a coffee shop"* and confirm you get a **one-job** mission rather than
three. If you get three, the plan is being ignored.

## 8. What we need

### A Gemini key that can generate — the current one cannot
1. **aistudio.google.com** → **Get API key** → **create it in a NEW project**. Choosing an
   existing project is what produced the zero-quota key we have (§7).
2. `GEMINI_API_KEY=...` in `.env` (gitignored — never commit it, never paste it in chat).
3. Launch a mission; look for `brains: gemini` instead of `offline`.

Get two. One for development, one untouched for the demo — the free quota is easy to burn on
rehearsals. **Rotate the key that was pasted into chat** once the hackathon is over.

### GoDaddy PAT — from the sponsor
Take `docs/godaddy-questions.md`. Ask question 1 first, then:

```dotenv
ANS_API_URL=https://api.ote-godaddy.com
ANS_PAT=<their token>
```

then `python scripts/check_ans.py` — read-only, thirty seconds, tells you which documented
assumptions survive contact.

### Domain — we have one
**`getcortex.vip`, registered at Porkbun.** The registrar does not matter to ANS: domain control
is proved with a DNS-01 TXT record.

Wired in as a switch rather than a rewrite. `ANS_DOMAIN=getcortex.vip` moves all five agents to
subdomains of it; leave it unset and they keep their fictional domains, which is the better story
for a simulator demo. **Both modes are tested end to end.**

Still needed: DNS records pointing those subdomains at wherever the agents run, and the agents
actually running there. See §9.

### Settled
- **The name is CortexAi**, matching the `getcortex.vip` domain. Renamed across both halves in one
  commit — 40 files, the package name, the `CORTEX_RUNTIME_MODE` env var and the localStorage key.
  Python tests, frontend typecheck, frontend unit tests and the production build all pass after it.
  The archived source briefs (`MASTER_PROMPT.md`, `PERIHLEION_MASTER_PROMPT.md/`, `documents/`)
  were deliberately left alone: they are the record of what we were handed, and rewriting them to
  match a later decision would make provenance useless.
- **The Next.js frontend ships** (§5). `dashboard/` is the fallback, not the product.

### Decisions still open
1. Gemini split (§7) — confirm or change.
2. Live ANS: full deployment, or the hybrid in §9.
5. **Disk space.** The dev machine is at 100% (0 bytes free); clearing the npm cache recovered
   ~150 MB, which is not enough to work in. `.git` is 54 MB and `docs/` is 44 MB and growing —
   mostly committed PNG screenshots, now joined by a 1.5 MB video. Every design review adds a few
   megabytes to history that can never be removed without a rewrite. Worth agreeing a convention
   today (screenshots outside git, or downscaled) — and a full disk will break the demo, not just
   the build.

## 9. The live-ANS reality check

Going live is not just a key. Registering `https://brand.<domain>` means the agent has to *be*
there — resolution hands that URL to whoever is hiring, we fetch the card from it and challenge
it, and the endpoint-mismatch policy check refuses agents answering from anywhere else. So
registering public URLs while running on localhost fails by design.

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — five subdomains to five local ports. Free, no server, about an hour.
- **A small VPS** with a reverse proxy. More control, more hours.
- **Hybrid — the recommendation.** Register *one* agent for real, prove resolution and
  verification against GoDaddy live on stage, run the mission on the simulator. Gets the ANS
  integration credit without betting the demo on deployment at 2am.

## 10. Parallel work packets

Remaining work is split into six packets in [`work/`](work/), drawn so **no two touch the same
file**. Each is a self-contained brief you can hand to a separate AI session, with its own branch,
its own file territory and its own done-criteria.

| | Packet | Blocked? | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | [Frontend data adapter](work/p1-frontend-adapter.md) | no | **critical** |
| P2 | [Trust and Guardian views](work/p2-frontend-views.md) | no | **critical** |
| P3 | [Backend API for the frontend](work/p3-backend-api.md) | no | high |
| P7 | [Live discovery over 216k agents](work/p7-live-discovery.md) | no | **high — prize track** |
| P8 | [Make the agents think](work/p8-llm.md) | needs a key | **high** |
| P6 | [Demo script and rehearsal](work/p6-demo.md) | no | high by Saturday |
| P4 | [Live ANS registration and deployment](work/p4-live-ans.md) | needs a PAT | medium |
| P5 | [Agent output quality](work/p5-agent-output.md) | no | medium |

Three or four at a time, not eight. If you can only staff four: **P1, P2, P7, P8** — connect the
two halves, win the track, and make the agents think.

[`work/fixtures/`](work/fixtures/) holds real captured output from a full run: 95 events, one
example of each of the 32 event types, and every REST response. That is what lets P2 build the
views before P1 has wired the data, so neither waits on the other.

## 11. Running it

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python scripts/run_all.py --fresh      # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

```bash
pytest                                  # 90 tests, no server needed
python scripts/smoke_test.py            # the whole demo, asserted (system must be running)
```

Use **Reset demo** between runs, and `--fresh` before the real thing so versions start clean.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Live ANS does not work in time | Simulator is the default and is honest about being one. Hybrid in §9. |
| Gemini quota burned in rehearsal | Second key reserved for the demo. |
| Gemini breaks the review-loop beat | Deterministic floor (§7). Not done yet — do it with the Gemini work. |
| A judge types an unusual mission | Plans are real graphs now; out-of-scope work is named, not faked. |
| Frontend integration runs out of time | `dashboard/` is wired and drives the demo today. Do not delete it until the Next.js app has run the demo twice. |
| Integration is the critical path | Two parallel pieces (§5). Fallback is `dashboard/`, which works today. |
| Dev machine out of disk | Prune `.git` and `docs/` screenshots; keep the demo machine above a few GB free. |
| Something fails live | Every dependency degrades visibly rather than silently. That is the story, not a failure of it. |
